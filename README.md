# ESP32 Wearable Health Monitoring System

An embedded wearable system designed to monitor vital signs, detect falls, and send emergency alerts in real time using ESP32 and multiple hardware modules.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project implements a complete wearable health monitoring device capable of:
- Measuring heart rate and SpO2.
- Measuring skin temperature.
- Detecting falls using accelerometer data.
- Sending emergency SMS alerts with GPS location.
- Displaying real-time data on an OLED screen.
- Providing local vibration alerts and manual cancel button.

The system is designed for reliability, real-time operation, and low-level hardware interaction.
